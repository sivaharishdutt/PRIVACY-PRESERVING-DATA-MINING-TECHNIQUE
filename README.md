# PRIVACY-PRESERVING-DATA-MINING-TECHNIQUE
	Clustering based PPDM:
Yi and Zhang overviewed various earlier solutions to preserve privacy of distributed k-means clustering and provided a formal definition for equally contributed multiparty protocol. An equally contributed multiparty k-means clustering is applied on vertically partitioned data, wherein each data site contributed k-means clustering evenly. According to basic concept, data sites collaborated to encrypt k values (each associated to a distance between the centre and point) with a common public key in each step of clustering. Then, it securely compared k values and outputted the index of the minimum without displaying the intermediate values. In some setting, this is practical and more efficient than Vaidyaâ€“Clifton protocol.
