ALGORITHM FOR CLUSTERING BASED PPDM:
1.	Start
2.	Get the input that is hospital data
3.	Data cleaning should be done before using the data, the data should be free from errors
4.	Select the platform in which you want to work in, here I used python for coding
5.	Import all required library files for the functioning of clustering and hiding operations
6.	Pass the dataset into a variable using pandas library file object
7.	Now take out k-means functionality from the imported library file that is sklearn.cluster
8.	Now set a range for the number of clusters to be formed regarding the given dataset
9.	Pass the dataset variable into the k-means functionality
10.	Append the resultant data into a new variable1
11.	Using the plot, title, xlable, ylable, show properties given by matplotlib library file, represent the data in clusters form based on the diagnosis attribute in the given dataset 
12.	Select the sensitive diagnosis attributes from the dataset
13.	After selecting the sensitive diagnosis attribute then we need to implement the privacy preserving technique
14.	By implementing the privacy preserving technique on the appended variable1, the sensitive diagnosis attribute will be hidden & will be used and seen only to the concerned doctor upon some conditions
15.	Now represent the clusters again, you will be able to see non-sensitive attribute clusters in the plot
16.	Stop.
